The Pre-Seed Objective: De-risking the Vision

We are seeking ?50 Lakhs to run a 6-month, data-driven pilot in a single, controlled environment. The goal is not to build the final product, but to de-risk the core business hypotheses and create immense value by proving:

1. User Hypothesis: Will people consistently report litter and pledge money?
2. Cleaner Hypothesis: Will cleaners reliably complete jobs for the offered reward?
3. Transaction Hypothesis: Can we facilitate a seamless, trusted transaction from report to payment?
4. Unit Economics Hypothesis: Can we achieve a positive contribution margin on each transaction?

Success in this pilot will position us for a significantly larger and higher-valuation Seed Round.

The Lean MVP: A Hyper-Focused "City-in-a-Box" Pilot

We will not build the full, scalable app. We will build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that proves the core loop in one manageable location.

Pilot Location: A Large University Campus (e.g., IIT Kharagpur) or a Large Gated Residential Society.

 Controlled Environment: Bounded geography, defined user & cleaner base.
 High Density: Concentrated litter problems for high visibility.
 Built-in Community: Easier to drive initial adoption and word-of-mouth.

MVP Core Features (The Absolute Essentials):

1. User App:
    Report Litter: Photo, location pin, pledge amount.
    View active and completed campaigns.
    UPI Payment integration (Razorpay SDK).
2. Cleaner App:
    View available jobs on a simple list/map.
    Claim a job.
    Upload "after" photo as proof.
3. Admin Web Panel:
    Manual verification of cleanup photos (to keep tech simple).
    Manual trigger for payments to cleaners.
    Basic dashboard to track KPIs.

Technology Stack for Speed & Cost:

 Frontend: React Native (single codebase for iOS & Android).
 Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL (on a single, well-configured cloud server).
 Maps: OpenStreetMap (free tier) to minimize API costs.
 Payments: Razorpay for UPI/card processing.

Detailed Use of Funds (?50 Lakhs)

This budget is allocated for a 6-month runway to achieve our pilot goals.

Category Allocation (? Lakhs) Justification

1. Lean Tech Team (70%) 35.0 The critical investment. 1 Project Lead, 1 Full-Stack Developer, 1 UI/UX Designer (freelance). Covers 6 months of salaries/stipends.
2. Cloud Infrastructure & Services (10%) 5.0 Server hosting, database, payment gateway fees, and essential third-party APIs (SMS, analytics).
3. Pilot Marketing & Operations (15%) 7.5 On-ground activation, digital ads within the campus/society, initial incentives for first users/cleaners, and operational contingencies.
4. Legal & Compliance (5%) 2.5 Company registration, GST, and payment gateway compliance.
TOTAL 50.0

Key Milestones & Deliverables (6-Month Timeline)

 Month 1-2: Team formation, finalize scope, and develop MVP.
 Month 3: Soft launch to a small user group (e.g., a single hostel). Iron out bugs.
 Month 4-5: Full pilot launch across the entire campus/society. Aggressive user/cleaner onboarding. Goal: 1,000 active users, 50 active cleaners.
 Month 6: Data Collection & Validation. Operate and measure relentlessly.

Defining Value: The Pre-Seed KPIs

Value at this stage is measured by validated learning and traction metrics, not just revenue. We will deliver:

1. A Functional, Though Lean, Product: A working MVP that has processed real transactions.
2. Validated Unit Economics:
    Average Pledge per Campaign: Target: ?150-?300.
    Cleaner Payout Efficiency: Demonstrate ability to manage payouts at 80-90% of pledge.
    Contribution Margin per Transaction: (Platform Fee - Direct Costs). Target: Positive.
3. Proof of Engagement:
    Monthly Active Users (MAU): 1,000+
    Campaign Completion Rate: >70%
    User Retention (Month 1-3): Demonstrate repeat usage.
4. A Compelling Seed Round Narrative:
    A video demo of the live app.
    A deck filled with real data and user testimonials.
    A clear, proven plan for scaling from 1 campus to 1 city.

The Roadmap: From Pilot to Seed

Pre-Seed (Now - ?50 Lakhs)

 Goal: Prove the core transaction works in one closed loop.
 Output: Validated KPIs, a working MVP, and a compelling data pack.

Seed Round (Target: ?3-5 Crores)

 Goal: Scale the validated model to an entire city (e.g., Bangalore).
 Use of Funds: Build the scalable tech platform, expand the team, and execute the city-wide GTM strategy.
 Valuation Driver: De-risked model with proven unit economics.

Our ask of ?50 Lakhs is the key to unlocking the ?5 Crore Seed Round. We are not asking for money to build a dream; we are asking for the resources to prove that the dream is a viable, fundable business.
